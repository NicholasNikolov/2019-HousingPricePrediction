# HousingPricePrediction
 Repository for building a predictive model for housing prices

This is a personal project that I have been working on to improve my data-cleaning, data visualizing, and predictive modeling skills. This is a regression problem with a bunch of information on house sales that went through including the number of rooms, square footage, whether or not there is a basement, etc.

Project Progress: In-progress

Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/ngee379k/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques

Future Improvements:
1. Perform more visual analysis of the data
2. Feature selection
3. Retain the variable names
